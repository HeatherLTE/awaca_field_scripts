# AWACA Field Scripts (OPUs - MRR and MIRA)

This is a repository for scripts deployed in the AWACA OPUs in Antarctica. Specifically, for the EPFL instruments (MRR and MIRA). The scripts relate to data transfer, quicklook creation, automatic watchdogs and transfer of quicklooks and moments to EPFL. See the README files in the mrr and mira folders.

The folder epfl_data_transfer is for scripts deployed on ltesrv5 for 'pulling' data and quicklooks from the OPU.
